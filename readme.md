# Azure Resource Visualizer

A visual way of visualizing, editing, and saving Azure Resource Manager Templates.

Here is a quick [YouTube screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xP1-IrtNMU) I put together to give you an overview of the project.

## Future / Project Status

There is still much to be done. Right now, the resource relationship parser is not perfect, but there is a plan in place to support all possible ARM Template dependencies. Also, the creation experience is currently lacking.

We're using a [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/41RiUCGs/azure-resource-visualizer) for managing the features and roadmap.

## Installation

	npm install
	npm install -g gulp bower tsd typescript
	bower install
	tsd install
	patch typings/backbone/backbone.d.ts backbonefix.patch

## Running

Build the website to serve it locally:

	gulp serve

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Old Typescript version installed. (use `tsc-v` to check)

**Solution:** Delete TypeScript from the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript`
